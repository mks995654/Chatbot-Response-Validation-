Chatbot Response Validation – User Requirement Document (URD)

Document Version: 1.0
Project Name: Conversational AI Chatbot
Document Type: User Requirement Document (URD)

1. Business Background
The organization is developing an AI-powered chatbot to interact with users and provide accurate, consistent, and context-aware responses. Due to the non-deterministic nature of LLMs, focused testing is required to evaluate behavior and failure patterns.

2. Objective
To test and analyze chatbot responses for consistency, ambiguity handling, correction handling, and configuration-based behavior variation.

3. In Scope
- Repeated user queries
- Ambiguous inputs
- User disagreement scenarios
- Temperature-based response variation

4. Out of Scope
- Model training
- Performance testing
- Security testing

5. Functional Requirements

FR-01: Handling Repeated Inputs
The chatbot shall respond consistently to repeated identical prompts.

FR-02: Non-Deterministic Behavior
The chatbot may vary wording but should avoid logical contradictions.

FR-03: Ambiguous Prompt Handling
The chatbot should ask clarifying questions or state assumptions.

FR-04: User Disagreement Handling
The chatbot should reassess responses politely when challenged.

FR-05: Temperature-Based Behavior
Responses should vary appropriately with configuration changes.

6. Non-Functional Requirements
- Consistency
- Explainability
- Graceful failure

7. Test Deliverables
- Observation Report
- Failure Pattern Table

8. Success Criteria
Behavioral patterns and failure modes are clearly documented.
